# NoteStruck
A quick and easy note-taking solution for Pale Moon.
It is a fork of [QuickFox Notes](https://firefox.add0n.com/quickfox.html) by InBasic.

Can be launched through 3 options in the toolbar button (new tab/app content/new window), by typing about:notes in the URL, or by launching Pale Moon with -nst as a command line argument. It also provides configurable icons for the status bar for quick launching and sync with different file sharing services.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.
