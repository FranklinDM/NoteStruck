extensions.amin.eft_bmnotes@gmail.com.description= QuickFox is a multi-tab note taking solution for Firefox and Thunderbird that employs the integrated bookmarks system or a single sqlite database to store notes. That is, if you already have either a bookmarks synchronization add-on (e.g.: XMarks) or a file synchronization software (e.g.: Dropbox, SugarSync, Syncplicity), your notes will be synchronized automatically, no more setups!
